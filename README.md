# A Quantitative structure–property study of reorganization energy
This repo hosts the dataset for the open-access paper [A quantitative structure–property study of reorganization energy for known p-type organic semiconductors](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/RA/C8RA07866A)

The Jupyter notebook is on the clustering of molecules based on the sphere-exclusion (as implemented in RdKit) and t-SNE algorithms (as implemented in Scikit-learn).

I used mols2grid for viewing molecules and molplotly for interactive plotting. Check it out:
