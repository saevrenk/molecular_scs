# A Quantitative structure–property study of reorganization energy
This repo hosts the [dataset](./osc_chemaxondes_elecdata_01092018.csv) for the open-access paper [A quantitative structure–property study of reorganization energy for known p-type organic semiconductors](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/RA/C8RA07866A).

The [Jupyter notebook](./osc_clustering.ipynb) is on the clustering of molecules based on the sphere-exclusion (as implemented in RdKit) and t-SNE algorithms (as implemented in Scikit-learn).

I used [mols2grid](https://mols2grid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for viewing molecules and [molplotly](https://github.com/wjm41/molplotly) for interactive plotting. Both packages are quite handy, check it out a movie of the app below:
